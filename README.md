I am a freelance data scientist, constantly working to improve my skills and learn new methods. I use Python and R for my work, mainly through RStudio and Jupyter. I am especially focused on working with time series data.

I became interested in data science and machine learning during my MSc studies in International Management, at Bocconi University.
After working as a business analyst in niche consulting startups, I decided to focus on developing my skills as a data scientist.
